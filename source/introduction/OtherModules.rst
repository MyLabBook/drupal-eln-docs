Other Modules and Distributions
======================================
This covers modules that are not currently used in MyLabBook that may be useful for future versions.
Drupal distributions are also mentioned as possibilities, where one or more features of the distribution
could be merged with MyLabBook to provide useful functionality for appropriate scenarios. Note, however, that
in our experience even though distributions may use Drupal as their basis, they have often been modified
to the point where it becomes difficult to integrate with other approaches.

Physical Fields Module
--------------------------
The `Physical Fields module <https://www.drupal.org/project/physical>`_ was originally created for use with
eCommerce sites where websites needed a way to designate measurements related to packaging. It couples a measurement
value with appropriate units for that measurement. Supported measurement types include the following.

   * Area
   * Length
   * Temperature
   * Volume
   * Weight

It also supports simple arithmetic regarding these units. If an experiment used some of these types of measurements
and arithmetic was needed then this module could be very useful.

Open Social Distribution
-------------------------
The `Open Social distribution <https://www.drupal.org/project/social>`_ has been one of the most successful
Drupal distributions because of its maturity and many features for supporting online communities. This could be
useful to integrate with MyLabBook for any type of lab scenario with multiple researchers or a single
researcher who was willing to accommodate the overhead of maintaining different experiments as different
groups.

Opigno Distribution
-----------------------
The `Opigno distribution <https://www.drupal.org/project/opigno>`_ is another successful distribution because of
its mature capabilities as well, this time as a Learning Management System. It could be useful to merge these
capabilities with MyLabBook for the scenario of an educational setting where learning is combined with
lab work.
