Experiments in a Drupal ELN
===============================
As explained in the introduction, the Experiment is one of two custom content types that is used in the
Drupal based ELN.
The fields for the Experiment pertain to the experiment as a whole. For the sake of ease of use,
the fields are grouped in different areas, each area being displayed under a given tab for the experiment.
These groups are covered in more detail in the Overview and Form sections listed below.
