Form for a Protocol Step
======================================

The form for a protocol step reflects the fields as described in :ref:`overview-of-a-protocol-step`. The tabs in the
middle left of the image below (highlighted in red) correspond to the tabs in the display of the protocol step.
Each tab contains one or more fields that is then displayed underneath the tab in the display of the protocol step.
The protocol step is somewhat different from the experiment in that you can also designate which tabs are visible
in the view of the protocol step, as show in Figure 1 below. Figure 2 below shows the fields that would be used for
creating a list of website URLs.
