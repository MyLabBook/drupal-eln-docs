Protocol Steps in a Drupal ELN
==================================
As explained in the introduction, the Protocol Step is one of two custom content types that is used in the
Drupal based ELN.
The fields for the Protocol Step are for setting the state of the Protocol Step or for collecting data
for the Protocol Step. As with the Experiment custom content type, the public interface uses tabs to
group the different fields together for display.
These groups are covered in more detail in the Overview and Form sections listed below.
