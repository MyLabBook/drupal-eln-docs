Form for an Experiment
==========================

The form for an experiment reflects the fields as described in :ref:`overview-of-an-experiment`. The tabs in the
middle left of the image below (highlighted in red) correspond to the tabs in the display of the experiment.
Each tab contains one or more fields that is then displayed underneath the tab in the display of the experiment.

Also highlighted in red, but this time towards the bottom of the image below, is the look-ahead text box where the
Protocol Steps are referenced for this experiment.
